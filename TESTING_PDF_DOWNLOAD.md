# Testing the PDF Download Feature

## Steps to Test:

1. **Open the Application**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5173
   - Log in to your account

2. **Navigate to Analytics Page**
   - Click on "Analytics" in the navigation menu

3. **Load Some Data**
   - Select a date range that has data (e.g., last 30 days or September 10-19, 2025)
   - Click "Apply Filter" button
   - Wait for the data to load and charts to render

4. **Download the PDF**
   - Once the data is displayed, you should see a green "Download Report" button in the top-right corner
   - Click the "Download Report" button
   - Wait for 1-2 seconds while the PDF is being generated

5. **Check the Result**
   - A PDF file should automatically download with the filename: `analytics-report-[startDate]-[endDate].pdf`
   - Open the PDF to verify it contains:
     - Summary cards (Total Wet/Dry Waste, Pollution, Global Warming)
     - Waste Data Chart
     - Environmental Impact Chart
     - Composition analysis charts
     - ML-powered suggestions
     - Detailed data table

## Troubleshooting:

### If nothing happens when clicking Download Report:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Press F12 to open Developer Tools
   - Go to the "Console" tab
   - Look for any errors (shown in red)
   - You should see: "Generating Analytics PDF report..." followed by "Analytics PDF generated successfully"

2. **Check Browser Popup Blocker**
   - Some browsers may block automatic downloads
   - Look for a popup blocker notification in your browser's address bar
   - Allow downloads from localhost:5173

3. **Check Download Permissions**
   - Make sure your browser has permission to download files
   - Check your browser's download settings

4. **Verify Data is Loaded**
   - Make sure you have data displayed on the analytics page
   - The Download Report button only appears when data is available

### Common Issues:

1. **Button is grayed out**: No data available for the selected date range
2. **Console shows errors**: Check that all dependencies are installed (jspdf, html2canvas)
3. **PDF is blank**: Charts may not have rendered properly before capture

### Expected Console Output:

When clicking Download Report, you should see:
```
Generating Analytics PDF report...
Analytics PDF generated successfully
```

## What's Fixed:

The issue was with the jspdf-autotable import. The code was using:
- `import 'jspdf-autotable';` (side-effect only)
- `(pdf as any).autoTable(...)` (TypeScript workaround)

Now it properly uses:
- `import autoTable from 'jspdf-autotable';` (named import)
- `autoTable(pdf, ...)` (proper function call)

This ensures the autoTable function is properly available and TypeScript can type-check it correctly.
